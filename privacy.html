    <section>
        <div class="container-narrow">
            <p>I, Tamsin Taylor (trading as Tamsin Urquhart) am the Data Controller and Processor. I adhere to the code of ethics of UKCP. The basis on which I keep client data is that of "Legitimate Interests". This means that the data is necessary for me to fulfil the contract that we have together (i.e. to provide therapy) and that it is data that you would reasonably expect me to hold and use.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2xl">The data I hold includes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic information such as name, email address, phone number</li>
                <li>Information that you give me as part of the work we do together</li>
                <li>Records of what interventions that I use (or potentially do not use) in our sessions</li>
                <li>Emails, texts and/or messages that are sent between us</li>
                <li>Information sent from any third party, e.g. GP</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some of the information that you give me may fall under the definition of special category of data as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation. The condition for processing this special data is "processing is necessary for medical diagnosis, the provision of health care or treatment pursuant to contract with a health professional".</p>

            <p>However, data on any criminal offences (including allegations, proceedings and convictions) is even more tightly controlled and so I need your specific consent in order to hold any such information.</p>

            <p>Data is not shared with anyone, except possibly your GP and my supervisor to ensure your continued care, and for any reasons covered by the Requirements for Disclosure section below. However, if you were to make a complaint about me to my professional body, I would be entitled to share your notes with any investigation procedures.</p>

            <p>The data is primarily used to enable me to provide therapy for you.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2xl">Details of where data is held:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any emails exchanged between us are stored on email servers operated by our respective email providers, and may also be stored on my computer and/or secure cloud storage. While I use services that comply with GDPR requirements, please be aware that email is not fully secure and should not be used for sensitive clinical information.</li>
                <li>Any that may be held on my mobile phone are code protected.</li>
                <li>Any texts/WhatsApp messages/Messenger messages sent between us (See Social Media and Electronic Information section) are held on my mobile phone which is code protected.</li>
                <li>Your notes are handwritten and are kept in a locked filing cabinet. A coding system enables the therapist to know whose notes are whose, but a stranger seeing the notes would not be able to identify who they referred to.</li>
                <li>Credit card information is shredded as soon as processed.</li>
                <li>If you use online banking then clearly these systems will hold your data. I will download from these systems for accounting purposes and this information is held on Free-agent accounting software which is secure and GDPR compliant, accessible for my accountant only and password protected.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your data is kept for 7 years. The length of time is based on the requirements of my insurer. After this time any paper records are shredded and computer records permanently deleted.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2xl">I take the security of data seriously and as such:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All data is held securely (see details of where data is held above)</li>
                <li>Any data transmitted is sent encrypted where possible</li>
                <li>For accounting purposes Excel spreadsheets are used</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However: I am not in control of data (including emails and texts) which you send me. Apps such as Facebook routinely access any information held and this is beyond my control.</p>

            <p>The right of access. I will provide you with all data I hold on you as soon as I can following a request (and definitely within 30 days, unless this is impossible due to holidays or illness).</p>

            <p>If there is any breach of data security I will give full details to the Information Commissioners Office and any person affected within 72 hours of the breach and do all possible to minimise any potential impact.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2xl">You have rights with regards to the data held:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The right to rectification.</strong> If any data I hold is incorrect, just let me know and I will correct it as soon as I can following a request (and definitely within 30 days, unless this is impossible due to holidays or illness).</li>
                <li><strong>The right to erasure.</strong> If you wish me to erase your data just let me know and I will delete any computer records and shred any paper records as soon as I can following a request (and definitely within 30 days, unless this is impossible due to holidays or illness).</li>
                <li><strong>The right to restrict processing.</strong> This would usually be a stop-gap measure before correction of any errors or before erasure.</li>
                <li><strong>The right to data portability.</strong> This might apply if you want your notes sent to another therapist for example, but it is likely that the easiest solution would come under the right to access, i.e. I would send the data to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-2xl">The right to object to:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I do not engage in these things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct marketing.</li>
                <li>Processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.</li>
                <li>Automated decision making and profiling.</li>
            </ul>
